# This class handles sprite sheets
# This was taken from www.scriptefun.com/transcript-2-using
# sprite-sheets-and-drawing-the-background
# I've added some code to fail if the file wasn't found..
# Note: When calling images_at the rect is the format:
# (x, y, x + offset, y + offset)

# Additional notes
# - Further adaptations from https://www.pygame.org/wiki/Spritesheet
# - Cleaned up overall formatting.
# - Updated from Python 2 -> Python 3.
