## Key Features:

### (1). Cats don't need the internet's approval + Invalidating Opinions
We at twitter for cats believe in innovation (real innovation). We have made an industry-changing decision of getting rid of features like 'like' (hehe), 'retweet' and all the other crap, and replaced it with a no-nonsense, easy to press 'Invalidate Opinion' Button.

Disagree with something you see? Just click on this button and watch the tweet slowly disappear into the void, never to be seen again (unless you restart the app, but this is a privacy feature. More details later).

### (2). Highly Secure
We don't collect your data, because simply put, you're not important to us. Who do you think you are, huh?
Also it's against the Terms and Conditions of the app to take offence at any tweet.

### (3). Piano for Cats
Inspired from the musical events of 9/11, we have integrated a cat friendly piano so your furry friend can explore his/her/it's hidden Beethoven

### (4). Sleepy Time for Cats
Count cats as you fall sleep as pleasent music plays in the background and notifies the user when it ticks to 100.

### (5) R.A.T.S
Kill anything that moves - Mice, Ladybugs, Ants or even a laser

### (6) ICBM System

### (7) Catroom for Cats

## Requirements:
