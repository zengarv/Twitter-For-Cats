# Twitter-For-Cats (v6.9)
> "My cat was happy even though I forgot to feed it. I thank twitter for cats."

## Vision:
Here at Twitter for Cats we boast about having high standards of quality. 
> In case of any bugs, we don't try to fix it. We accept them and move on
and so is life. Sometimes you don't get a say in how things are. You have to learn to move on.

## Key Features:

### (1). Cats don't need the internet's approval + Invalidating Opinions
We at twitter for cats believe in innovation (real innovation). We have made an industry-changing decision of getting rid of features like 'like' (hehe), 'retweet' and all the other crap, and replaced it with a no-nonsense, easy to press 'Invalidate Opinion' Button.

Disagree with something you see? Just click on this button and watch the tweet slowly disappear into the void, never to be seen again (unless you restart the app, but this is a privacy feature. More details later).

### (2). Highly Secure
We don't collect your data, because simply put, you're not important to us. Who do you think you are, huh?
Also it's against the Terms and Conditions of the app to take offence at any tweet.

### (3). Piano for Cats
Inspired from the musical events of 9/11, we have integrated a cat friendly piano so your furry friend can explore his/her/it's hidden Beethoven
New in v3.7: Bongo cat

### (4). Sleepy Time for Cats
Count cats as you fall sleep as pleasent music plays in the background and notifies the user when it ticks to 100.

### (5) R.A.T.S
Kill anything that moves - Mice, Ladybugs, Ants or even a laser

### (6) ICBM System

### (7) Catroom for Cats (Humans shouldn't use it, It's against our T&C)

### (8) Self Destruct Sequence

### (9) Extremely smooth Burger menu (feat. burgers)
This highly piece of innovative text lets you switch around the different pages this app has to offer

### (10) It works (mostly)
Owing to our high standards here at twitter for cats, we are proud to provide you an app that works (most of the time, unless you try to break, which is your fault and we would be coming to you with a lawsuit, since it's against our policies to try to break the app)

### (11) Revolutionary Aspect Ratio
We have revolutionized the market of digital screens by using a brand-new, never seen before aspect ratio <ratio to be inserted here> (What can I say, it's a very revolutionary app. It's also our vision: Revolution.)

## Requirements:
- Python or something  (3.10+ ig if it doesn't run on older ones)
- Pygame maybe
- Pandas (Note: Panda must not be allergic to cat)
