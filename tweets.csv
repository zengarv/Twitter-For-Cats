I was just petting my owner when I realised that he is just a smart monkey. I hate monkeys. `
Time to wake up and explore this new house! #adventure `
A big human appeared. Hmmm. I'll just watch from the safety of my bed. #observer `
When they pet me I purr and wait for my next meal. #spoiled `
Napping in the sun is the best. #lazycat `
Just because I'm small doesn't mean I'm not fierce. #predator `
I love chasing shadows and playing with string. #kittyfun `
I'm a master of hiding and napping in small spaces. #camouflage `
I hate getting wet but I love drinking from the faucet. Go figure. #thirsty `
I'm restless and want to run but I'll just lay here for now. #lazycat `
Yawn. Stretching. What day is it today? Looks like breakfast time. #hungry `
Just curled up in a sunny spot with a good book #purrfection `
Sleeping in lots today because it's raining outside #lazycat `
Chasing a mouse around the house #fun `
Snuggling up with my human #love `
When will these humans learn that I need to be fed NOW?! #hungry `
Loving the sunbeam coming in through the window. #relaxing `
So much new territory to explore! #excited `
Bored now. Nothing to do. #sigh `
Napping in the sun is the best. #Happy `
Vim sucks. Normal kets use IDEs `
I'm so tired. #nap `
OMG new toy! #playtime `
Just curled up in a sunny spot. #relaxing `
Life is a cruel prank played on the living. Death mocks us all. I've got to tell Nikolaj he's going to become an orphan. Again. ` 
Yum, I caught a mouse! #proudmoment `
Loving the sunbeam coming in through the window! #Happy `
Yawning and stretching after a long nap... feeling lazy today. #Sleepy `
Kinda rude when mah owner gets food from the kitchen and eats it all himself `
I don't like it when I eat the food and it actually gets over `
Cats are immune to fall damage `
All of my plans for the future involve me waking up tomorrow with a sudden sense of discipline and adherence to routine that i have never displayed even once in my life `

Being Ket is launching it's summer kitten collection on the occasion of independence of Denmark. @SalmanKet `
Lunchtime is my favorite time second only to GamingTime #GamingKet `
Just had to take a bath because my hooman forced me to while he been stinking for the past 4 days. Such hipocrisy. `
Amul Doodh Peeta hai Billa ` 
The best way to wake up on time is to not sleep ` 
Every passing minute you get closer to death `
TikTok is gay `
Science teacher very cruel, mange fair copy, nickel copper zinc `
4 out of 5 kets suffer from diarrhea. I'm the 5th who enjoys it `
Zak Spider's Justice Ket was one of the best movies to come out this decade `
Us cats have a secret society on mercury and these evolved monkeys know nothing about it. `
Boop. `
Finally upgraded to townhall lvl 12 on Clash of Cats `
Eat -> Sleep -> Eat -> Repeat `
My friend made a powerpoint yesterday. He said, "When you Excel, people Spreadsheet about you." Now I gotta spread the Word.`
Life is all about exploring and finding new things - Like I just found out I am adopted. `
You can't keep living in your comfort zone - you have to push yourself to try new things. I just jumped from the thirteenth floor and did not break any major bones (I broke my front legs but I'm sure they're not that useful) `
Don't take things for granted - everything(Me) is precious and temporary. `
Life is all about balance - you have to find a balance between work and play, dark and light, etc. `
Don't be afraid to express your true self - be authentic. Like just today, I tore up da vinci's original painting. I'm pretty sure I did a better job than him. (I gave it a 'finishing touch') `
Don't worry so much about what other people think - focus on living your own life. Don't care about what your hooman says or tells. Never listen to him. Be true to yourself. `
Remember that you're not alone in this world - we're all connected. Unless you're a hooman, in which case you suck (I hate hoomans) `
I want to be petted but my owner is disabled `
